        Letra :<br>
             Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
            Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br>
            Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision<br>
            Always had high, high hopes<br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
            Didn't know how but I always had a feeling<br>
            I was gonna be that one in a million<br>
            Always had high, high hopes<br>
            Mama said<br>
            Fulfill the prophecy<br>
            Be something greater<br>
            Go make a legacy<br>
            Manifest destiny<br>
            Back in the days<br>
            We wanted everything, wanted everything<br>
            Mama said<br>
            Burn your biographies<br>
            Rewrite your history<br>
            Light up your wildest dreams<br>
            Museum victories, everyday<br>
            We wanted everything, wanted everything<br>
            Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated<br>
            All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting<br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
            Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br>
            Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision<br>
            Always had high, high hopes<br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
            Didn't know how but I always had a feeling<br>
            I was gonna be that one in a million<br>
            Always had high, high hopes (high, high hopes)<br>
            Mama said<br>
            It's uphill for oddities<br>
            Stranger crusaders<br>
            Ain't ever wannabes<br>
            The weird and the novelties<br>
            Don't ever change<br>
            We wanted everything, wanted everything<br>
            Stay up on that rise<br>
            Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh<br>
            Stay up on that rise<br>
            Stay up on that rise and never come down<br>
            Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated<br>
            All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting<br>
            They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me<br>
            So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see<br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
            Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br>
            Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision<br>
            Always had high, high hopes<br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
            Didn't know how but I always had a feeling<br>
            I was gonna be that one in a million<br>
            Always had high, high hopes<br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
            Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br>
            Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision<br>
            Always had high, high hopes<br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
            Didn't know how but I always had a feeling<br>
            I was gonna be that one in a million<br>
            Always had high, high hopes (high, high hopes)</br>

                Letra:<br>
                Carry on, my wayward son<br>
There'll be peace when you are done<br>
Lay your weary head to rest<br>
Don't you cry no more<br>
Once I rose above the noise and confusion<br>
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion<br>
I was soaring ever higher<br>
But I flew too high<br>
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man<br>
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man<br>
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming<br>
I can hear them say<br>
Carry on, my wayward son<br>
There'll be peace when you are done<br>
Lay your weary head to rest<br>
Don't you cry no more<br>
Masquerading as a man with a reason<br>
My charade is the event of the season<br>
And if I claim to be a wise man, well<br>
It surely means that I don't know<br>
On a stormy sea of moving emotion<br>
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean<br>
I set a course for winds of fortune<br>
But I hear the voices say<br>
Carry on my wayward son<br>
There'll be peace when you are done<br>
Lay your weary head to rest<br>
Don't you cry no more, no<br>
Carry on, you will always remember<br>
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor<br>
Now your life's no longer empty<br>
Surely heaven waits for you<br>
Carry on, my wayward son<br>
There'll be peace when you are done<br>
Lay your weary head to rest<br>
Don't you cry, don't you cry no more<br>
No more<br>

        Letra:<br>
        Mm-mmm<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Mm-mmm<br>
Yeah<br>
My momma called, seen you on TV, son<br>
Said shit done changed ever since we was on<br>
I dreamed it all ever since I was young<br>
They said I wouldn't be nothing<br>
Now they always say congratulations<br>
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation<br>
They ain't never had the dedication<br>
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it<br>
Yeah, we made it<br>
They was never friendly, yeah<br>
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah<br>
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah<br>
But I know I had to have it, yeah<br>
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah<br>
I be itching like a addict, yeah<br>
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah<br>
But they didn't know me last year, yeah<br>
Everyone wanna act like they important<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Everyone counting on me, drop the ball<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Everything costing like I'm at the bottom, yeah, yeah<br>
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky<br>
How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?<br>
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side<br>
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes<br>
My momma called, seen you on TV, son<br>
Said shit done changed ever since we was<br> on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young<br>
They said I wouldn't be nothing<br>
Now they always say congratulations<br>
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation<br>
They ain't never had the dedication<br>
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it<br>
Yeah, we made it<br>
I was patient, yeah, oh<br>
I was patient, aye, oh<br>
Now I can scream that we made it<br>
Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulations<br>
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation<br>
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby<br>
I'm looking for someone to call, baby<br>
But right now, I got a situation<br>
Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins<br>
Big rings, champagne<br>
My life is like a ball game<br>
But instead, I'm in the trap though<br>
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl<br>
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls<br>
Top-floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post<br>
Malone, I got a play on my phone, aye<br>
You know what I'm on, aye<br>
Huncho Houdini is gone, aye<br>
My momma called, seen you on TV, son<br>
Said shit done changed ever since we was on<br>
I dreamed it all ever since I was young<br>
They said I wouldn't be nothing<br>
Now they always say congratulations<br>
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation<br>
They ain't never had the dedication<br>
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it<br>
Yeah, we made it<br>
Hey, hey<br>
Hey, hey<br>
Hey, hey<br>
Hey, hey<br>

Braços abertos sempre a esperar<br>
Pois bem, cheguei<br>
Quero ficar bem à vontade<br>
Na verdade, eu sou assim<br>
Descobridor dos sete mares<br>
Navegar eu quero<br>
No mar a luz azul me guia<br>

Com a clareza e o brilho do cristal<br>
Transando as cores desta vida<br>
Vou colorindo a alegria de chegar<br>
Boa Viagem, Ubatuba<br>
Grumaí, Leme e Guarujá<br>
